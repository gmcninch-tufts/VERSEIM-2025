/- Sahan: The main results in this file should hold only for alternating forms.

  Major results (Completed):
  - ....
  Major results (Planned):
  - Any nondegenerate alternating bilinear form is hyperbolic
  - - Corollary: Nondegenerate alternating bilinear form is dimension 2
  - - Corollary: Nondegenerate alternating bilinear forms of equal dimension
      are isomorphic (as bilinear form spaces)
