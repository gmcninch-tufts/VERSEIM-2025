# Overview for week one 

  For this week

  2025-06-02 -- 2025-06-06

  I’d like for us to meet as a group as follows:

  - Mon after lunch (2:30 PM or so?)  
  - Tues, Thur 1:30-3:00 PM  
  - Wed, Fri 10:30-12:00 AM  

# Goals for the week:

## installation tasks

  we should all have the following stuff installed on a computer we can
  use:

  - a working installation of Lean

    -- see https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html --
  
    where you can work! This includes installation of an *editor*
    
    (probably VSCode

    -- see https://code.visualstudio.com/
    
    )

  - git

    Here you already have accounts, and maybe you have the correct
    software installed already but we should check. In order to make
    commits, I’m pretty sure you’ll need to create a SSH key, and if
    that sounds like mumbo jumbo that is fine and I’ll help you out --
    this is a “do it once and forget about it” sort of task.

    Even if I’m wrong and you don’t *have* to create an SSH key, you’ll
    still want to because it’ll save you from having to type passwords
    over-and-over-and-over...

## content goals

  we don’t have to solve all the technical problems all at once!  We
  should get started on understanding Lean as a proof assistant. I think
  we should more-or-less follow the presentation in “Mathematics in
  Lean”

  https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/

  You should read/skim the first chapter.

  I’m going to produce some exercises for you to work on next
  week. (Probably similar to what is already in the book, but going
  forward I plan to try to steer us towards the sort of point-of-view
  that I have in mind for our formalization goals).

## remarks

  This week, I’m imaging the Monday afternoon meeting (after the kickoff
  and after the lunch) as sort of a "meet-and-greet" for our group, and
  we can talk through some of the installation matters.

  On the remaining days, I’ll have some content ready to talk
  about/interact with which I’ll make available in the git
  repository. During our meetings we can talk through the material and
  try to do some formalization in real time.

  And between meetings you can work on the exercises (or read in
  “mathematics in lean”).

  Typically I’ll be around for more of the day than our meeting (but
  e.g. on Tue/Thur I’m planning to do a bicycle ride in the morning,
  which is why I scheduled our meeting after lunch.

  If this schedule ends up being clumsy for some reason, I’m open to
  suggestions for future weeks!
