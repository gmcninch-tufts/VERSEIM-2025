- [[https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Combinatorics/Hall/Finite.html][Hall's Marriage Theorem]] (the link is to the mathlib proof of this)

- formalize [Shapiro 2015] Theorem 15.6
  entries in m-th power of adjacency matrix count "walks of length m"

- graphs and eigenvalues of adjacency matrix formalize [Shapiro 2015]
  Theorem 15.10 - for a graph of diameter d, adjacency matrix has at
  least d+1 distinct eigenvalues

- Handshaking Lemma:

  In any undirected graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is
  equal to twice the number of edges.
  
- Euler's Theorem:

  A connected graph can be traversed in a single path (an Eulerian
  path) that visits every edge exactly once if and only if it has
  exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. If all vertices have
  even degree, the path can start and end at the same vertex (an
  Eulerian circuit).
