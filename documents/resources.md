# The main place to find information is the [Lean Community website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) (<https://leanprover-community.github.io/>).

# for information about installing Lean, see these links from the site just mentioned

-   [getting
    started](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html)
-   [using
    `lake`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html)

# the [Learning Resources page](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html) contains a lot of great links, including
