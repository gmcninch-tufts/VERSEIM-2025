- have a look at some of the [literature](literature.md)

- look at the `contrapose` and `contrapose!` tactics in \S3 of Mathematics in Lean

  Maybe on Monday someone can explain the difference, with an example?
  
  
- look at the `obtain` tactic (maybe search in `math in lean`)

  explain what it does, with an example?

- read about `ex falso` and `False.elim` at the end of \S3.3 in
  Math-in-lean.
