* some general, ongoing tasks

  - have a look at some of the literature:
  
     - [Formalizing Galois Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10988)
	 - [A bi‑directional extensible interface between Lean and Mathematica](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07758)
	 - [Formalizing the ring of Witt vectors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02595)

     - skim through the list of papers headed "Formalization using
       Lean"
       [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/papers.html)

   mainly I suggest glancing at these just to see the style, and get a
   sense of things. 

* finish reading §3 of [`math in
  Lean`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/)
  While there are surely lots of things we haven't discussed "aloud",
  we have talked roughly about the material found in §3.1-§3.4.
  So you should read §3.5 and §3.6.

  We can talk on Monday (or Tuesday, Clea...) about anything that seems murky.
  
  In particular, it'd be great if you could try to complete the proofs
  of `convertsTo_add` and `convergesTo_mul_const` and `aux` in §3.6, and read
  the proof of `convergesTo_mul` (which uses those results).
  
  Also: I'd like to try the following (which will be good practice for
  seminar Thursday):
  
  For the following topics, I'm asking the person assigned the topic
  to give our group a description aloud and prepare a couple of
  examples.  Maybe you can give one example just from the text, and
  then try to construct an example illustrating the usage, yourself.
  
  I'm imagining this as very informal!
  
  Let's do this on Tuesday, both because I didn't get it written down
  until lunchtime on Saturday, and because Clea is away on Monday.
  
  - Katherine, can you do this for the `ext` tactic discussed in §3.6
    of math-in-lean

  - Sahan, can you do this for use of the `rcases` tactic, especially
    its use for unpacking an `or`

  - Clea, I know you are traveling. But maybe you can give the group a
    description of – and a couple of examples of the `ex falso` tactic.


* this week

  we'll keep meeting at 10:30 if that works with everyone. On Monday
  maybe we'll just meet in the morning.

  I'll start talking Monday about how Lean represents sets and what
  we think of as "ordinary things mathematicians do with sets". This
  is §4 in math-in-lean, and it is probably useful if you "read
  ahead".

  On Tuesday, we can rotate through the student-led stuff in the
  morning, and after lunch I'll push further in §4.

  
* TA

  Saskia is an algebra-oriented TA who can work with REU
  participants. Mostly we are focused on Lean for now, and I don't
  believe she knows much about Lean. But eventually I think she could
  be a useful resource once we get started with a formalization task
  (helping you understand the pen-and-paper version of proofs).
  
  *but* meanwhile a useful thing she could show you is how to use
  LaTeX to typeset slides for a math talk.
  
  I'm going to write her and copy you three, suggesting this, and
  maybe you can come up with a time to meet with her.
